# WEEK 1

###### 12/14/2020 5:53pm - 7:36pm

I finished problem 1 (DNA), problem 2 (RNA), problem 3 (REVC), and problem 4 (IPRB). I created a stuff.py for things that I might use again so I can just import it. For now I just have a read file function. I found the first three problems simple, but I struggled with the inheritance probability problem. In the end, I drew a diagram to help me understand how the probabilities worked, and after that it was fine. Halfway through I was debating whether or not to brute force it, but I decided not to :)
