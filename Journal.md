# Lab 4 Journal

## WEEK 1

###### 12/14/2020 - 5:53pm - 7:36pm (1h 43min)

I finished problem 1 (DNA), problem 2 (RNA), problem 3 (REVC), and problem 4 (IPRB). I created a stuff.py for things that I might use again so I can just import it. For now I just have a read file function. I found the first three problems simple, but I struggled with the inheritance probability problem. In the end, I drew a diagram to help me understand how the probabilities worked, and after that it was fine. Halfway through I was debating whether or not to brute force it, but I decided not to :)

I started work on problem 5 (FIB) on monday, so I wanted to finish it. I was having a lot of trouble, mostly because I read the question wrong, and thought it was talking about individual rabbits instead of pairs. I then did problem 6 (GC), which I found easier than FIB. I renamed stuff.py to resources.py, and added  the `read_fasta(file_path)` function to it (which I yoinked from lab 2). I learned how to use the `max()`function to find which sequence had the highest GC content. Problem 7 (HAMM) was relatively simple.
